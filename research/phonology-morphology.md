### Opacity
Phonological opacity plays a pivotal role in debates about the phonology-morphology interface. In a recent paper (to appear in *Glossa*), I identify and analyze a productive opaque interaction in dialectal Serbian between two processes that apply in the same cyclic domain, contravening the Cycle-internal transparency principle of Stratal Optimality Theory. This, I argue, shows that opacity is a diverse phenomenon with multiple sources, not exclusively an epiphenomenon of phonology-morphology interleaving.

### Alternations, exceptions, and allomorph selection
One line of my research focuses on morphophonology. Morphophonological alternations are fascinatingly complex, often involving not only regular phonological processes but also frequency-related lexical tendencies and many other factors. I am also interested in morpheme-specific phonological behavior, whereby certain morphemes or classes of morphemes deviate from general phonological patterns. In recent projects, I have examined phonological effects on allomorph realization in BCMS and what they can tell us about the timing of phonologically conditioned allomorph selection.
