Phonological opacity occupies a pivotal role in debates about the phonology-morphology interface. In my work, I identify and analyze a productive opaque interaction in dialectal Serbian between two processes that apply in the same cyclic domain, contravening the Cycle-internal transparency principle of Stratal Optimality Theory. This, I argue, shows that opacity is a diverse phenomenon with multiple sources, not exclusively an epiphenomenon of phonology-morphology interleaving.
