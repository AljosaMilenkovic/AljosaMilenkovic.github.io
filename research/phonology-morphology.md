### Opacity
Phonological opacity plays a pivotal role in debates about the phonology-morphology interface. In a recent paper (resubmitted to *Glossa*), I identify and analyze a productive opaque interaction in dialectal Serbian between two processes that apply in the same cyclic domain, contravening the Cycle-internal transparency principle of Stratal Optimality Theory. This, I argue, shows that opacity is a diverse phenomenon with multiple sources, not exclusively an epiphenomenon of phonology-morphology interleaving.

### Phonologically conditioned allomorph selection
I study the so-called mobile *a*-alternations in BCMS, where a series of morphemes alternatie between vowel-less and CV variants. The pattern is subject to antigemination, with the vowel-less allomorph being strongly avoided before similar consonants. Allomorph selection shows gradient sensitivity to the degree of feature similarity between consonants at morpheme junctures **at the input level**. This information is completely obscured in the output of phonology. Therefore, a parallel OT approach that tries to derive allomorph selection in phonology proper fails to capture
