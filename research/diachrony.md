I began my academic journey as an historical linguist during my undergraduate studies, focusing on Balto-Slavic and ancient Germanic languages, as well as the reconstruction of Proto-Indo-European, the hypothetical ancestor of many languages spoken across Europe and parts of Asia. This early interest led to several papers and conference presentations which addressed topics such as the regularity of sound change, diachronic prosody, and etymology.

I am currently investigating the relative chronology and phonological mechanisms of vowel lengthening processes in South Slavic languages and dialects. This project contributes to our understanding of how sonority and prosodic structure interact in historical perspective.
