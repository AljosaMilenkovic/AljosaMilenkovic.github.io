### Cumulativity

A unifying theme across my research projects is cumulativity in phonology, the combined effect of multiple phonological factors or multiple instances of a single factor on the well-formedness, probability, or acceptability of linguistic structures. For the past two decades, cumulativity has figured as a testing ground for competing constraint-based frameworks in phonology. My research on natural language prosody and metered verse shows that cumulative interactions between phonological constraints are ubiquitous, as predicted by Harmonic Grammar, but not by Optimality Theory.

I am particularly interested in superlinear cumulativity, where the joint contribution of interacting constraints exceeds the sum of their independent contributions. Hereâ€™s a nice example of superlinearity from my dissertation:

  <em>Superlinear cumulativity: the effect of violating both constraints simultaneously is more detrimental than expected; the probability of doubly-violating structures is much lower than the expected cumulative contribution.</em>
</p>

Superlinearity poses a challenge for virtually all constraint-based frameworks. It raises the question of whether phonological theory requires explicit interaction terms between constraints, known in phonology as constraint conjunctions (Smolensky 2006, *The Harmonic Mind*). My forthcoming *Phonology* paper and my dissertation argue that conjoined constraints are necessary in both Optimality Theory and Harmonic Grammar. Even when conjunctions are allowed, Harmonic Grammar, especially Maxent as its probabilistic variant, outperforms competing theoretical frameworks.
